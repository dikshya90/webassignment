						Introducing myself, I'm Dikshya Ghale, student of NAMI college. My hometown is Besishahar and I'm currently living in chaldol, Kathmandu. Graduating SLC from Land Star English School and higher secondary education from Reliance Interntional Academy was great experience for me. I am reading in NAMI college currently in order to persue my carrer in IT.<br>

						Though web developing is new to me, it has become one of the interesting subject for me. I want to flourish myself as a successful developer in the coming days. It is something that will let you use your mind in a creative way. Thus, being a developer would be really tough as well as interesting.
