		<h2>Introduction:</h2><br>
			<p>Web designing refers to the development of websites which is displayed in internet. Websites like google, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter etc. are the output of web designing. Websites are of different types. Some may be learning websites, some may be entertaining websites whereas some can be personal websites. This is the report of personal website which is developed based on brief provided by the University of Northampton. Each student was supposed to develop a personal CV website which would include landing page, bio page, contact page, social page, CV page and model_gp page. This website would be the personal website of their own which would include information about themselves. Since it includes different pages like bio, social, cv, etc. it would be easy for others to know about them. The interested people can access their website through internet. Websites can be created using HTML, CSS and Javascript. But as per the brief provided by the university of Northampton, the task is to be completed using HTML and CSS only. However, using Javascript won’t be bad but the marks won’t be counted. Stating about the different pages, the first one is homepage also called landing page. This page is supposed to be accessed by the webpage setting on GitHub. The homepage which has been created has to be accessed from the GitHub. One can create any design of their own. But navigation bar should contain the lists like home, bio, cv, contact, social and model_gp. Footer is compulsory for every page. Through this page, there should be access to other pages. As mentioned above other pages are bio, social, contact, cv and model_gp. Properties like flexbox was highly recommended.</p>
		<h2>My experience on doing project</h2><br>
			<p>Web designing may seem easy while writing html tags. But it isn’t that easy. In fact, it became more challenging while doing the task. So, the task was overall discussed in the group among the friends though it’s an individual work. The requirement for the project was discussed in group too. It became easier to complete the task by doing discussion.</p>
 			<p>At the onset, I was facing difficulty in starting the project. Thinking about the design and applying HMTL, CSS was really tough. So, different templates were viewed at first to take the idea for design. After searching different templates, a design for landing page was created. Struggle for creating homepage was challenging but was interesting at the same time. After developing homepage, it wasn’t that difficult to create other websites. The link to open other pages were written at landing page. Overall making website was fun. No matter how difficult and tough, it was at the beginning, the understanding level for web designing have been increased now. CSS properties like padding, margin, background-image, background-color, word-spacing, letter-spacing, text-decoration, flex etc. have been understood very clearly while doing this project. Making the CV website for the first time was a great experience due to which the understanding level for HTML, CSS have been increased. It won’t be that difficult in the future to make any personal websites using HTML and CSS. After doing the project, I developed confidence on myself that I can use HTML and CSS to develop the simple websites. It was fun and interesting developing a personal website. It enhanced the understanding level for my designing skills.</p> 

		<h2> UI Design</h2>
			<p>The full form of UI is User Interface meaning the front design of any website. Users interact with the UI of the websites. So, it is the main part of designing where developers have to apply different designing methodologies in order to make the website eye friendly as well as user friendly. In this phase, color combination plays vital role. It is because if the color combination isn’t that good users might not like what you’ve created. Hence, choosing appropriate color is most. Along with this, it should be designed in a way where almost every user can access it easily. This is the phase where a developer need to work hard. Templates from different resources were analyzed at first and after looking different websites, the Personal CV website was created. Different videos from YouTube were also preferred for the task. Along with this, the materials provided by the University was preferred to complete the task.</p>
			<p>In this project, I have used rgba(0,0,0,0.1) color mainly. Since, the color isn’t that bright and eye catching, users can easily interact with the website that has been created. As the users prefer the website with good design and layout, the website is developed with the aim of meeting users goal. The header and footer part is same for all pages but the contents within it are different. The main part is, this website is responsive. It can be viewed in other devices except desktop too.</p> 
			<p>Here are some of the websites which were referred to complete the task.</p> 
<img src="css/ui.jpg" ><br>
file:///C:/final%20web/model-gp.html<br>
			<p>I referred this video on YouTube for my landing page. Though design looks similar, I used my won codes to design the page.</p><br>
		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
 			<p>These are the sketches for the pages which I had used to create my webpage.</p>
 			<img src="css/home.jpg"><br>
 			<p>This is the rough sketch for my home page of website.</p>
 			<img src="css/about.jpg"><br>

 			<img src="css/co.jpg"><br>
 		<h2>Validation</h2>
